Today:
++ + * - -- buttons for size and such

Textbox overhaul:
Sprite editor maybe?
Image as textbox option
Probably need seperate textbox edit window, will probably have to move some stuff over
Font picker
Font size
Font color?
Text Orientation
Still need to adjust max width of textbox
Editor where you can adjust the wraparound in real time


It's important that at some point in the future you switch over to profiles and states and such. No hardcoded talking sprites. Just a bunch of saved idles that can be made into talking sprites and also saved. That's when you make them interact with each other


Some sort of indicator that I'm typing?


Have it select from your PCs font list?

Maybe some sound stuff?

"At the 5ms mark hit the downbeat"

Saving downbeat data and regular/half-time/quarter-time to each preset!

tap to create tempo integrated in with the start from downbeat feature

Shrimple debug mode where it displays the sprite number to the right of the gif


Making sure that the default looping dance doesn't desync at any point. If another animation plays it still keeps track of what frame it should be on. A universal frame incrementer. So that the idle frame never goes off sync!

Next is some overhauls to the way mainwindow is displayed

You want to be able to edit it super easily in the ui!



Really just presets. Those seem important. This might be easier now with the whole character and text box positioning thing. You also need to figure out the whole textbox thing. That's a whole can of worms.
