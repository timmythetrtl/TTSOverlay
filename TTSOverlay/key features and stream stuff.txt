Some notes:

A button to start it from downbeat
Making the downbeat selector combo box

Shrimple debug mode where it displays the sprite number to the right of the gif


Adjust character width and height through manual numbers

Making a sprite load in at the proper size and aspect ratio scaling.

Making sure that the default looping dance doesn't desync at any point. If another animation plays it still keeps track of what frame it should be on.

Next is some overhauls to the way mainwindow is displayed

You want to be able to edit it super easily in the ui!

After figuring out file integration with OBS and that whole mess. Saving downbeat data and regular/half-time/quarter-time to each preset!

Really just presets. Those seem important. This might be easier now with the whole character and text box positioning thing. You also need to figure out the whole textbox thing. That's a whole can of worms.

Bug where the bpm ion the clickable text box doesn't adjust to the proper displayed bpm on the right
